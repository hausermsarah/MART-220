            <p>Lets take a look at where coffee can come from! Coffee beans primarily come from regions near the equator, known as the Coffee Belt. These regions include countries like Ethiopia, Colombia, Brazil, and Vietnam. The beans are harvested from coffee plants, processed, and then roasted to develop their flavor. The two main types of coffee beans are Arabica and Robusta, each with its own unique taste profile.</p>
